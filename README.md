track an MTG collection

add/search/update/remove cards from collection

uses MTG's API to retrieve card data
MTG API is included as I created two custom methods in the CardAPI class
one for retrieving all instances of a card (multiple printings), 
the other for retrieving the first non-promo version of a card
(where multiverse ID is >0)
